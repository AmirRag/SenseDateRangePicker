#### 1.0.7
 * icons inside html buttons
 
#### 1.0.6
 * Added qSortByState and qSortByNumeric to properties

Still works better with a date field with all dates loaded.


### TODO
 * include dates made available only up to the actual dates available
 * add user defined ranges past 6 or 12 months, etc?
